vim-config
==========

my vim configuration, which I use to code in python mostly but really for every programming language

there are many plugins that I link to and use - and probably credits for where I got certain files from. It'll be added here in due time.


this is the content of my .vim + a copy of my .vimrc ; to install simply pull into a ~/.vim and copy vimrc to ~/.vimrc
