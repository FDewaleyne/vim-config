vim-config
==========

My vim configuration, which I use to code in python mostly - later with java and c++ support probably. There are many plugins that I link to and use, fetched by submodules to keep a relatively constant update level and prevent breaking everything.


this is the content of my .vim folder, linked to active github projects mirroring the current vim plugins in use.

Originaly based on  http://blog.dispatched.ch/2009/05/24/vim-as-python-ide/

#### To install :

~~~
$ git pull https://github.com/FDewaleyne/vim-config.git
$ cd vim-config
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
~~~

arrange the synced folder to be your .vim and you're done - installing ruby may be required for a few plugins (more doc to come)
